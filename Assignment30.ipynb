Why CDF is used?\n\nThe CDF gives the probability that a random variable X takes a value less than or equal to \nx. For a random variable  X, the CDF is defined as: F(x)=P(X≤x)\n\nExample: For a die roll: The CDF at x=3 is P(X≤3) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 0.5 \n\nUses:\nSummarizes Probabilities: Shows cumulative probabilities for all values up to x.\nRange Probabilities: Helps compute probabilities over an interval (e.g., P(a≤X≤b)).\nStatistical Analysis: Used in hypothesis testing, finding percentiles, and comparing distributions",

What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable that has exactly two outcomes: success or failure. \nIt is used to model binary events. Parameter: The probability of success p (and failure is 1−p).\nExample: Coin Toss: Tossing a fair coin has two outcomes: heads (success) or tails (failure). If p=0.5, the coin has a Bernoulli distribution.\n\nDifference:\nBernoulli Distribution: Models a single trial with two outcomes (success/failure). Example: Tossing a coin once.\nBinomial Distribution: Models multiple independent Bernoulli trials. Example: Tossing a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads (successes).\n",
